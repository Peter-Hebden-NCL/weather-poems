# Weather interface source code

**This is a template for a poetry interface that uses weather data to determine which poem should be shown to the reader. The interface uses available location data from the device and uses this to query Open Weather, a free weather API.**



### Content

This code repository contains the index.html file for the Weather interface, which contains all of the JS and CSS. The poems have been replaced by placeholder text, which is clearly marked to show where poems should be included.
